               <p>Assualt 3 and Related Offenses leads in arrests and shows how prevalent interpersonal violence is in New York. This suggests that conflicts leading to physical harm, whether intentional, reckless, or negligent, are pervasive. Felony Assault and Petit Larceny also constitute a large portion of the crimes. Specifically, Petit Larceny has to do with smaller-scale thefts, and make indicate economic struggles. Together, these categories reveal a story of a city struggling with both violent and non-violent crimes. Another takeway to make is that other offenses like Sex Crimes are much lower in numbers. This leads to questions of whether those crimes are actually rare or just harder to catch</p>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>There is an overall clear disparity between the number of male and female arrests. Males constitute the majority of crime perpetrators and make up 82.1% of total arrests.This is important to keep note of when doing further investigation into the societal, behavioral, or systemic factors that contribute to this dispairty. On the flip side, women make up 17.6% of arrests which is, again, an important figure to keep in mind when investigating the specific challenges faced by women. The unknown category represents only 0.334% of the arrests and demonstrates a high level of data categorization accuracy from the source of the data.  This reliability suggests a confidence in the data and the decisions that may be made based off of it. </p>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>The 25-44 age group dominates arrests. They have an arrest count near the 600k mark which is significantly higher than any other age group.  This suggests that this demographic might be disproportionality involved in activities that lead to arrests or they might be under closer scrutiny by law encorcement. It's also interesting that the 18-24 age group and 45-65 age group have approximately the same number of arrest counts. One might initially infer the younger age group would have disproportionately more arrests as they navigate greater life transitions and peer pressures. However, with similar arrest counts, the data suggests that both age group are experiencing similar systemtic facotrs in terms of  enviornments and facing similar community disparities. Additionally, it's interesting to see that there are much lower arrest rates for minors and 65+.  This could suggest differences in societal norms and legal policies towards these groups.  </p>

            <p>The line chart shows total arrests by date from 2018 to 2023.  As illustrated, there is not a consistent trend and there are many peaks and troughs along the graph. One takeaway to be made is there there is a sharp decline in crime counts in the year 2020.  This was likely related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly decreased public presence and associatively illegal activities. However, crime counts showed a steady incline up to the year 2023 from that point. There also seems to be some stabilization by 2022 and 2023 where there are fewer significant fluctuations compared to earlier years. </p>
